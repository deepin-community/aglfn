Description: Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts
 AGL (Adobe Glyph List) maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
 purpose of deriving content. AGLFN (Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts) is a
 subset of AGL that excludes the glyph names associated with the PUA
 (Private Use Area), and is meant to specify preferred glyph names for
 new fonts. Also included is the ITC Zapf Dingbats Glyph List, which is
 similar to AGL in that it maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
 purpose of deriving content, but only for the glyphs in the ITC Zapf
 Dingbats font.
 .
 Be sure to visit the AGL Specification and Developer Documentation pages
 for detailed information about naming glyphs, interpreting glyph names,
 and developing OpenType fonts.
